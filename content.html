    <h3>Hey there! I'm Zach Varga and I'm a digital Swiss Army knife based out of COS.</h3>
      <p>
        I do web development, UX/UI, graphic design, illustration, iconography, font design, and more. I'm always catering to the needs of my clients; building custom features and layouts to help see their visions come to life.
