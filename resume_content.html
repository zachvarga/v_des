        Fix My Blinds: June 2016 - May 2021
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Redesigned the header and footer of their website to focus on mobile-first design. In this project, I made UX/UI improvements and wrote custom javascript to reload a random image of customer care specialists in the footer. (2020)</li>
        <li>Setup Git and version control with additional security measures. (2020)</li>
        <li><b>Helped lead 2019 website update, redesign, and migration.</b></li>
        <p>
          <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">Worked alongside a third party developer company to migrate e-commerce platforms from Magento to Shopify Plus. I worked in the Shopify Plus CMS to create products, templates, navigation, search function, and install applications. I played a role in developing a custom theme for the Shopify Plus platform to cater to the needs of Fix My Blinds (HTML, CSS, JS, Liquid, and some JSON to enable CMS customizability). I also generated detailed site maps and mass-redirect maps, used the Shogun page builder application to make pages and templates to transfer all of Wordpress content over to Shopify.</span>
        </p><br><br>
        <li>In 2018, I worked alongside a third party developer to create a new section of our website to feature repair guide content within the Wordpress framework.</li>
        <p>
          <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">Utilized the Divi Theme to create custom templates, global templates, and injected custom css to maintain consistency from our Magento theme to Wordpress integration. I directed a team to utilize the templates I had made, and created individual pages for over 100 repair guides. In part of this project, I wrote custom javascript to create a <span id="fmb-link"><a href="https://fixmyblinds.com/pages/changing-the-string-in-a-cord-tilt-mechanism-on-2-horizontal-blinds" style="color: #37423b; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">unique image hover-feature</a></span>.
          </span>
        </p><br><br>
        <li>In 2017, I helped play a major role in migrating from Volusion to Magento for their e-commerce platform. On this project, I learned PHP on the job in order to help meet deadlines while equipping our in-house team with someone who knew the language. I used HTML and CSS to help create a custom theme using Magento's infrastructure.</li>
        <p>
          <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">For this big redesign, I utilized Adobe XD to wireframe and mockup the UX/UI flow. From concept and planning with the team, to final pixel-pushing, I was able to see this project through from start to finish.
          </span>
        </p><br><br>
        <li>In 2016, I played a major role in rebranding the company. I designed a new logo and created new visual language (color palette, iconography, font usage, etc.)</li>
