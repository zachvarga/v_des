          Fix My Blinds - Current employer (since June 2016)
      </div>
        <ul>
          <li>- I redesigned the header and footer of our website to focus on mobile-first design. In this project, I made UX/UI improvements and wrote custom javascript to reload a random image of one of our customer care specialists in the footer.</li>
          <li>- With the help of a third party developer company, I was able to setup Git and version control with additional security measures.</li>
          <li><b>- Helped lead 2019 website update, redesign, and migration.</b></li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">We worked alongside a third party developer company to migrate e-commerce platforms from Magento to Shopify Plus. In this project, I worked with the COO and Product Specialist heavily in the Shopify Plus CMS to create products, templates, navigation, search function, and install applications. I played a role in developing a custom theme for the Shopify Plus platform to cater to the needs of Fix My Blinds. This involved developing in HTML, CSS, JS, Liquid, and some backend JSON to enable CMS customizablity.<br>
            I also generated detailed site maps and mass-redirect maps, used the Shogun page builder application to make pages and templates to transfer all of Wordpress content over to Shopify's equivalent of the visual builder in Divi. I learned the coding language Liquid during this project in order to manipulate theme code to execute design vision, that way we could have in-house expertise to do whatever we needed.</span>
          </p><br><br>
          <li>- In 2018, we worked alongside a third party developer to create a new section of our website to feature repair guide content within the Wordpress framework.</li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">We utilized the Divi Theme to create custom templates, global templates, and injected custom css to maintain consistency from our Magento theme to wordpress integration. I directed a team to utilize the templates I had made, and together we were able to create individual pages for over 100 repair guides. In part of this project, I wrote custom javascript to allow for users to hover over different images in repair guides, and the main image would change to what was being hovered-over. This feature is still active in our current site on pages <span id="fmb-link"><a href="https://fixmyblinds.com/pages/changing-the-string-in-a-cord-tilt-mechanism-on-2-horizontal-blinds" style="color: #37423b; font-weight: bold;" target="_blank">like this</a></span>.
            </span>
          </p><br><br>
          <li>- In 2017, I helped play a major role in migrating from Volusion to Magento for our e-commerce platform. On this project, I learned PHP on the job in order to help meet deadlines while equipping our in-house team with someone who knew the language. Along with that, I used HTML and CSS to help create a custom theme using Magento's infrastructure.</li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">For this big redesign, I first utilized Adobe XD to wireframe and mockup the UX/UI flow of what our new site would look and feel like. From concept and planning with the team, to final coding and pixel-pushing, I was able to see this project through from start to finish.
            </span>
          </p><br><br>
          <li><b>- Assisted in leading the 2020-2021 video production studio build.</b></li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">In this highly collaborative project, I helped maintain the vision of Fix My Blinds by advocating for the client-side. From concept planning and design to the final building and implementation of studio equipment, I had the privilege of working hand-in-hand with independent contractors, CEO, and COO of the company to make their dreams a reality.
            Key responsibilities - I helped to push the project along and coordinated with schedules, ordering equipment, checking on budget, and constantly ensuring that the vision was being executed. I also had a large influence in the overall design and approach to the studio, gear, and methods of filming.
            </span>
          </p><br><br>
          <li>- Created LUTS and color grading presets in Davinci Resolve, as well as audio presets in Resolve and Adobe Audition.</li>
          <li>- Made a new logo animation for recording starting in 2021.</li>
          <li>- Composed, recorded, and mastered a song for Fix My Blinds to use as background music in videos.</li>
          <li>- Created systems and processes for tasks within the media department.</li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">The intent of this was to maintain brand consistency and have documentation in place for training and reference. I would test and research the best ways to do something, and then implement that new system to see which one worked best for Fix My Blinds.</span>
          </p><br><br>
          <li>- Photographed over 300 new products for the catalog in 2020. A few of these had 40 different colors alone.</li>
          <li>- In 2016, I played a major role in rebranding the company. I designed a new logo and created new visual language (color palette, iconography, font usage).</li>
          <li>- Designed blind systems for diagrams.</li>
          <p>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">Used Adobe Illustrator to create life-like simulations of all different kinds of blinds and shades. These are used for assisting in customers learning how much string they need to purchase on the /string webpage I built.</span>
