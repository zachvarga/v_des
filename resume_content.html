          Fix My Blinds - Current employer (since June 2016)
      </div>
        <ul>
          <li><b>- Assisted in leading the 2020-2021 video production studio build.</b></li>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">In this highly collaborative project, I helped maintain the vision of Fix My Blinds by advocating for the client-side. From concept planning and design to the final building and implementation of studio equipment, I had the privilege of working hand-in-hand with independent contractors, CEO, and COO of the company to make their dreams a reality.
            Key responsibilities - I helped to push the project along and coordinated with schedules, ordering equipment, checking on budget, and constantly ensuring that the vision was being executed. I also had a large influence in the overall design and approach to the studio, gear, and methods of filming.
            </span><br><br>
          <li>- Created LUTS and color grading presets in Davinci Resolve, as well as audio presets in Resolve and Adobe Audition.</li>
          <li>- Made a new logo animation for recording starting in 2021.</li>
          <li>- Composed, recorded, and mastered a song for Fix My Blinds to use as background music in videos.</li>
          <li>- Created systems and processes for tasks within the media department.</li>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">The intent of this was to maintain brand consistency and have documentation in place for training and reference. I would test and research the best ways to do something, and then implement that new system to see which one worked best for Fix My Blinds.</span><br><br>
          <li>- I redesigned the header and footer of our website to focus on mobile-first design. In this project, I made UX/UI improvements and wrote custom javascript to reload a random image of one of our customer care specialists in the footer.</li>
          <li>- With the help of a third party developer company, I was able to setup Git and version control with additional security measures.</li>
          <li>- Photographed over 300 new products for the catalog in 2020. A few of these had 40 different colors alone.</li>
          <li><b>- Helped lead 2019 website update, redesign, and migration.</b></li>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">We worked alongside a third party developer company to migrate e-commerce platforms from Magento to Shopify Plus. In this project, I worked with the COO and Product Specialist heavily in the Shopify Plus CMS to create products, templates, navigation, search function, and install applications.<br>
            Key responsibilities - I also generated detailed site maps and mass-redirect maps, used the Shogun page builder application to make pages and templates to transfer all of Wordpress content over. I learned the coding language Liquid in order to manipulate theme code to execute design vision. I worked with JSON schema and liquid code to create new snippets to turn on/off and populate text in visual theme customizer within the main Shopify theme CMS.</span><br><br>
          <li>- In 2018, we worked alongside a third party developer to create a new section of our website to feature repair guide content within the Wordpress framework.</li>
          <li>- In 2016, I played a major role in rebranding the company. I designed a new logo and created new visual language (color palette, iconography, font usage).</li>
          <li>- Designed blind systems for diagrams.</li>
            <span style="text-indent: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; opacity: .8;">Used Adobe Illustrator to create life-like simulations of all different kinds of blinds and shades. These are used for assisting in customers learning how much string they need to purchase on the /string webpage I built.</span>
